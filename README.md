🔧⚙️ In this project, I studied the [documentation](http://www.cplusplus.com/) of containers from [STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library) and tried to reproduce their work.

### I had a task before me:
I had to implement the following containers: [std::list](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/list/list/), [std::vector](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/), [std::map](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/), [std::set](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/set/set/) and the following adapters: [std::stack](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stack/stack/), [std::queue](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/queue/queue/). I couldn't use STL and any algorithms and functions from C++11 and newer. I also had to create an automated testing system for my containers to demonstrate how they work!
